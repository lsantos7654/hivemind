- [ ] change librarian to only be aware of enabled agents
- [ ] need some way to organize or create directories for similar agents in the tui for better organization. Should be able to enable/disable all agents in a directory.
    - [ ] I want to introduce the concept of private agents, essentially this is the same thing as agents except they are not committed to git since they contain confidential info they only live locally.


tui
- clicking space to select brings the cursor all the way back to the top
- searching works kind of but I can't see what I'm typing and once I find what I'm looking for I can't escape search. pressing enter doesn't do anything, pressing escape removes the search filter
